# FAQ

## Avoid asking subjective questions where...

- every answer is equally valid: “What’s your favorite ______?”
- your answer is provided along with the question, and you expect more answers: “I use ______ for ______, what do you use?”
- there is no actual problem to be solved: “I’m curious if other people feel like I do.”
- you are asking an open-ended, hypothetical question: “What if ______ happened?”
- your question is just a rant in disguise: “______ sucks, am I right?”

## Some subjective questions are allowed, but “subjective” does not mean “anything goes”. All subjective questions are expected to be \*constructive\*.

- inspire answers that explain “why” and “how”
- tend to have long, not short, answers
- have a constructive, fair, and impartial tone
- invite sharing experiences over opinions
- insist that opinion be backed up with facts and references
- are more than just mindless social fun

## How do I ask a good question?

- ### Write a title that summarizes the specific problem

- ### Introduce the problem before you post any code

- ### Help others reproduce the problem

## My advice

> ### Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
> ### Practice makes progress.
> ### All experience comes from mistakes.
> ### Don't be one of the leeches.

## The Zen of Python

> Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
> Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
> Simple is better than complex.<br>
> Complex is better than complicated.<br>
> Flat is better than nested.<br>
> Sparse is better than dense.<br>
> Readability counts.<br>
> Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.<br>
> Errors should never pass silently. Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
> In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
> Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
> Now is better than never.<br>
> Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
> If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
> If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
> Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>

## Environment

No specific configuration. As long as your compiler supports C99 standard.
