# C Preprocessor

## Objectives

Use #include to develop large programs. 

Use #define to create macros with and without arguments. 

Use conditional compilation to specify portions of a program that should not always be compiled (such as code that assists you in debugging). 

Display error messages during conditional compilation. 

Use assertions to test whether the values of expressions are correct.
