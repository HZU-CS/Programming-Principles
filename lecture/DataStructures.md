# C Data Structures

## Objectives

Allocate and free memory dynamically for data objects. 

Form linked data structures using pointers, self-referential structures and recursion. 

Create and manipulate linked lists, queues, stacks and binary trees.

Learn important applications of linked data structures. 

Study Secure C programming recommendations for pointers and dynamic memory allocation. 

Optionally build your own compiler in the exercises.
